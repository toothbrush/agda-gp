attempts:

- tried to give a spine representation of spine, but later realised that sum is
  achieved by a list of Sigs in spine.
- attempting to convert a [Sig] into LIGD representation. Possibly generating the EP.
- defining spine and ligd in agda. not very interesting, but something time was spent on.

- spine == sum of products, except for existential types. 
- by converting to regular / ligd you lose information, since spine keeps track of the constructors



TODO:

- write about ligd and spine: comparison / similarities and possible translation
- why is spine supposedly bigger than ligd?

Notes:

I think that we should mention in the report that the addition of
Type? is purely to help Agda, and that any instance of type being
converted from is recursive, and that any other is constant.
