\section{Introduction}


\section{Aim}

The aim of this project was to embed LIGD and Spine in Agda, a dependently typed programming language,
and then to define a (partial) isomorphism between the two styles of generic views.

As a result of some implementational difficulties (LIGD proved impractical to implement in Agda) we switched from
LIGD to Regular. The details of how and why can be found in the following sections.

As it turns out, any Regular representation can be translated into a Spine representation, but not all Spine representations
can be translated into Regular (in particular existential types pose a problem in Regular).
